title: Documentation Strategy

[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is an approach to quality in technical documentation. It describes an information architecture that emerges from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users.

The name Diátaxis comes from the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: dia (“across”) and taxis (“arrangement”).

Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.

In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) corresponds to a different user need. Each fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.
